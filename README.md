Well commented code, good for learning purpose.
.
This was a university algorithm design project, so for comparing the sorting algorithms with each other in comparison and movement, i put two counter for each algorithm so we can compare this two algorithm with  each other.
Other algorithms : Floyd algorithm=> show the shortest distance between every pair of vertices. Dijkstra algorithm=> show the shortest distance from vertex 0.
